# agrirouter-api-protobuf-definitions

## Project description

### The agrirouter

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, regardless of vendor or manufacturer. Agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data.

As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0. Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer. You retain full control over your data. Even data exchange with service providers (e.g. agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated: Data are very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, is intelligently connected to other datasets.

### The current project you're looking at

This project contains the internal Google Protocol Buffer (protobuf) definitions for the communication with the agrirouter. All the definitions are part of the communcation structure of the agrirouter. For more informations see the technical integration guide which you can download from the developer section on the product website.
